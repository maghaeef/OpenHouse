**House Price Prediction Test**

Build a complete machine learning pipeline using the provided housing data to estimate home sale prices based on various property characteristics. Your primary objective is to develop a robust prediction model. It is recommended that the final model use linear regression, although using a different model will not be rewarded or punished.

Your solution will be evaluated on the following areas:
1. **Data Handling and Exploration:** Import, clean, and prepare the dataset for analysis. Perform exploratory data analysis to identify trends and patterns.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Create and select meaningful features from the dataset.
3. **Modeling:** Develop your prediction model, applying best practices in model development.
4. **Evaluation:** Assess the performance of your model using appropriate metrics.

Your approach should demonstrate technical proficiency while reflecting a thoughtful application of sound modeling practices throughout the entire pipeline. Every assumption and modification made during the process must be clearly outlined. 
As output, a jupyter notebook-based project is preferred, but raw python is acceptable as well. Ensure all relevant outputs are included, the code is runnable, and any required packages are present in a requirements file.
